      <h2>November</h2>
      <p>Slightly over3 years ago, my young daughter Alina died, aged 22 months after 5 months in ICU at Sydney Children's
        Hospital. She had a long persistent 'chronic' virus, with 40x visits to her GP of all the same progressive symptoms,
        starting with conjunctivitis at 2 weeks old, HFMD, rashes, vomiting, and migrating to her throat and lungs where it
        developed into frequent tonsillitis, wheeze, cough, croup and stridor. Then seizures, EPC seizures until finally her
        death (accumulated infections to include Pneumonia). All documented on her GP records, made by 15 different GP's and
        Hospital staff that all independently agreed she “just
        had a mild virus” and “it would pass within a week”. it never did, it always returned. Every symptom was very easily
        recognized and unmistakable viral symptoms, even testing positive to an Entero/Rhinovirus swab.</p>

      <p>It appeared to be a similar sequalae to the media reporting of Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans in the UK</p>

      <p>The number of times we had to deal with croup was far more than mentioned than the GP's medical records, but we had
        learnt to spot the signs in advance (namely a change or smell on her breath in the late evening) so often gave her
        Redipred (steroids) prior to bed in preparation of the night ahead. One GP got so impatient of our frequent visits she
        just signed over a script for x5 repeats. No GP seemed willing to escalate the issue, despite requests</p>

      <p>We were given steroids on most occasions and even told “she has back to back viruses - from daycare”, and this seem
        to control the issue to some extent, except at night when she would cough for a few hours and had a low grade
        temperature (sweaty head)</p>

      <p>In recognizing childhood viruses, I believe an inner-city GP would have seen more than anyone, and it doesn't take
        more than general parental knowledge to know these symptoms anyway</p>

      <p>From 6 months old we were visiting the GP's once every week, if not twice a week. they just noted the symptoms. Dr
        Sharma a GP advised the father of the “red flags” of concern for enteroviruses. (Fever, rash, lethargy, cough,
        stridor)</p>

      <p>It was a peculiar illness, as by morning all symptoms would all but disappear, within hours of onset. On many
        occasions the GP would send us home as there were no visible symptoms, despite us seeing them only earlier in the day.
        The illness had a baseline of symptoms which was progressive and would advance and retreat just as quickly.
        We noticed that her eye was developing Amblyopia on her left side and she was frequently wheezy, and this was
        associated with a cough. These symptoms seemed to happen simultaneously. She would have brief episodes of full body
        rashes, low grade temperatures, vomiting blood, red eye, sore throat, croup, stridor and this distinct smell on her
        breath. Another
        strange observations was If she heard a deep noise from the passing cars, regardless of how asleep she was, she would
        make abrupt and brief jerking movements, then fall back asleep. We knew it was unusual, but not to its significance
      </p>


      <p>Alina was otherwise a very bright girl, very sociable and with an excellent sense of humour, she enjoyed teasing her
        classmates with her superb comical timing, as well as dancing, with her favourite being the PotBelleez “Shout” or
        Bhangra. As a child she he was thriving. She understood both Hindi from her mother, and carerer as well as English
        from
        her father Patrick. There was no question of any mental impairment or physical abnormalities.</p>
